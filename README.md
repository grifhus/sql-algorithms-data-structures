## Introduction

This repository is a collection of exercises and examples to practice SQL queries, various algorithms, and data structures. The goal is to provide a comprehensive resource for learning and mastering these topics.

## Structure

The repository is organized into three main sections:

1. **Algorithms**
2. **Data Structures**
3. **SQL**

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/grifhus/sql-algorithms-data-structures.git
    cd sql-algorithms-data-structures
    ```

2. **Explore the directories**:
    Navigate through the `algorithms`, `data-structures`, and `sql` directories to find exercises and examples.

3. **Start practicing**:
    Work on the exercises, review the provided examples, and try to implement your own solutions.
